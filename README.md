## Description

### _This project is a simple e-commerce web application built with React to practice state management and component-based architecture. It simulates a store where users can browse items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The application demonstrates key React concepts such as:

State Management: Using React's useState and useReducer to manage application state.

Component Reusability: Creating reusable components like Button, Item, and Cart.

Props and Prop Types: Passing data between components and validating props.

Event Handling: Managing user interactions like adding/removing items and updating quantities.

Conditional Rendering: Displaying components based on state (e.g., cart visibility, item details).

The project is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it ideal for beginners learning React or developers looking to reinforce their skills._
